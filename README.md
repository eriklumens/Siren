# Composer
1. install curl
sudo apt-get install curl

2. download composer.phar
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

3. move composer.phar to local binaries folder so we can execute the command
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin
(test: composer.phar in any folder, command must be found)


# Install Laravel via Composer
1. download laravel installer
composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"

2. add laravel command to PATH
we need to do this so we can execute the laravel command from any place on our system
a good place to this is in the .bashrc file:
sudo nano .bashrc
go to the end of the file and add:
export PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
exit the terminal and start a new one to reload the PATH
(test: laravel in any folder, command must be found)

# Create a new project with Laravel
(<S.H.> : I have already done this, this structure is already in Git.)

1. Go to the main Siren folder
cd Siren

2. Start the new project
laravel new siren

3. Our directory structure is now:
[Siren]
   - readme.md
   - [siren]
       - [app]
       - [bootstrap]
       - package.json
       - ....
